*** TO BE DEVELOPED AFTER FURTHER INVESTIGATION: Each parameter has multiple choices and selection of one value is permitted for each parameter with the exception of 'Absence of deformity'. All 4 values for 'Absence of deformity' should be available to the clinician and the clinician should select as many as are relevant for the individual. If all are 4 values are selected, the score for 'Absence of deformity' is 4 and if less than 4 values are selected, the score is recorded as 0.
. The 'Total score' is the sum of all parameters***
