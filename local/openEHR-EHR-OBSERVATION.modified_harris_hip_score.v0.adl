The Harris Hip Score is used to record the result of a structured clinical assessment of hip function. It evaluates domains such as pain, function, absence of deformity, and range of motion. This score is commonly applied in orthopaedic settings to assess outcomes following hip surgery or to monitor hip-related conditions over time.

It is intended for use by clinicians in both inpatient and outpatient environments, particularly in rehabilitation and surgical follow-up. The score provides a standardized way to quantify hip function and compare results across time or between patients.
